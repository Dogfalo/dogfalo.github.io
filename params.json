{"name":"98-173 Git Stuco","tagline":"","body":"### 98-174 Modern Version Control With Git\r\nGit is a modern version control system that tracks changes and enables collaboration by merging work from different users. This course will briefly explore various version control techniques and focus on the basics of using Git. We will also cover some advanced uses of git.\r\n\r\nThis is a 3-unit StuCo, graded pass/fail based on homework completion, a midterm, and a final exam. We meet every Wednesday at 6:30pm in GHC 4211 for about an hour.\r\n\r\n-Week 1: Git Introduction and Setting up a Repository (Setting up SSH)\r\n-Week 2: Basic Git Commands (Clone | Add | Commit | Push)\r\n-Week 3: Git History\r\n-Week 4: Viewing Git Log and Undoing Things\r\n-Week 5: Branching and Merging \r\n-Week 6: Resolving Merge Conflicts and Using Git Tools\r\n-Week 7: Workflows\r\n-Week 8: Rebasing\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
